# Vbook

### About
During Hack the North 2020, from January 15-17, myself and 3 others created Vbook, a Facebook Messenger Bot using IBM Watson & Facebook Messenger API.

### What it does

It is an extension for Facebook Messenger, in which users can speak into a chat and send a message without typing. As well, we implemented a bot that accepts answers, and uses machine learning and collaborative filtering to give a response.
